# GasOptimized Voting System Updates

## Contract Update

The voting system has been updated with a new contract deployed on Polygon at address `0x14b1c2df30f31f43126e6bef94009d0b1b9cc51c`. This new contract includes several improvements:

1. **Enhanced EIP-712 Integration**: 
   - Better signature verification for meta-transactions
   - Properly typed data signing for improved security

2. **Improved Relayer Management**:
   - More gas-efficient relayer authorization system
   - Better allowance management between general pool and specific relayers
   - Dedicated functions for default relayer management

3. **Gas Optimizations**:
   - Optimized bitmap storage for votes
   - Packed data structures for gas savings
   - Efficient Merkle tree verification

## Frontend Changes

Several updates have been made to the frontend application to support the new contract features:

1. **Updated Contract Integration**:
   - New contract address on Polygon
   - Updated ABI reflecting new function signatures
   - EIP-712 signature implementation

2. **Browser Compatibility**:
   - Added polyfills for Buffer and Node.js modules
   - Updated Vite configuration for proper browser compatibility
   - Fixed CSS issues

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Improved error handling for transaction rejections
   - Better user feedback with toast notifications
   - More informative error messages

## Using the Application

The application now supports all original features plus the new relayer functionality:

1. **Creating Polls**:
   - Public or whitelist-only polls
   - Fixed deposit amount for relayer gas reimbursement

2. **Voting**:
   - Direct on-chain voting (user pays gas)
   - Meta-transactions via relayers (gasless for voters)

3. **Relayer Management** (Admin Only):
   - Authorize/deauthorize relayers
   - Set relayer allowances
   - Update default relayer

## Development Notes

- The contract is implemented using Solidity 0.8.18
- Frontend uses React with ethers.js v5.7.2
- Vite serves as the development and build tool
- Buffer polyfills added for Node.js compatibility in browser
